        <p>This will be the photoshop challenge that we do in class and the text that goes with it along with pictures. I am excited to see what the challenge will be and what we will have to do. I have some experience in Photoshop already from classes in high school, and two of my other classes this semester require me to have Adobe software. I know that I will definitely become familiar with Photoshop even more this semester, along with Illustrator and InDesign. I am looking forward to it a lot, so that I can become better at using the software and have lots of practice in it and to experiment in it for many different areas.</p>
